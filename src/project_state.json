  "summary": "Odds storage must include both numerator and denominator (or decimal form) so 5/1 vs 5/2 are not conflated. Store computed implied probability with each race. Prediction output must include value edge (predictedProb – impliedProb) for betting decisions. Update bet sizing to factor in edge + variance, not just raw probability. Model weight updates should be driven by log-loss, not arbitrary Bayesian vibes. Add session window (e.g., last 50 races) for recency-weighted stats blended with lifetime stats. Store predicted probabilities per race for real calibration tracking. Ensure contender identity (name or number) is stored separately from lane/slot index. Cache computed contender stats on-device for fast load times.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Use on-device persistent storage (e.g., AsyncStorage) for races/history and learned parameters.",
    "Prediction algorithm should incorporate historical user-entered outcomes to adapt over time (simple incremental model acceptable).",
    "Provide a one-tap reset that clears all persisted keys related to races/model state.",
    "Odds should be stored/handled as fractional odds with fixed denominator 1; UI shows \"-/1\" placeholder when numerator is blank.",

    "Bet sizing guidance should derive from predicted probability vs odds and enforce: 1,000 minimum, 10,000 maximum, step size 1,000.",

    "Simplify race outcome logging to store only the top-3 finish order (1st/2nd/3rd).",
