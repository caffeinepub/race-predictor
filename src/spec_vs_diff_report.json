One specific acceptance criterion for the New Entry odds input blank state (showing “-/1”) cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary due to truncation.",

      "reason": "A formatter for the placeholder (\"-/1\") was added, but the EntryFlow UI portion that would show the placeholder/suffix next to the input is truncated; there is no explicit evidence in the visible diff that the numerator input uses placeholder '-' while showing a fixed '/1' suffix in the New Entry rows.",
