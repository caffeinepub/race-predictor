# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the odds input field in the New Entry flow to display fractional format with a /1 denominator and 0 placeholder.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the odds numerator input placeholder text to '0' instead of the current placeholder
- Add a non-editable '/1' label immediately to the right of each odds numerator input field
- Ensure the /1 label is consistently styled and positioned across all 6 contender rows

**User-visible outcome:** When creating a new entry, users will see odds input fields with a '0' placeholder and a '/1' label next to each field, clearly indicating the fractional format with a fixed denominator of 1.
