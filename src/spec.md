# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the Dashboard tab from the navigation bar so users can no longer access it.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove Dashboard tab UI element from the navigation bar
- Remove Dashboard route from the routing configuration in App.tsx

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see four tabs (Info, New Entry, Stats, History) instead of five, and cannot navigate to the Dashboard screen from the tab bar.
